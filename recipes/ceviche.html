        <li>The first thing you should do to make the easy Peruvian ceviche recipe is to squeeze the 12 lemons to extract their juice, reserve it for later. Then, cut the fish into pieces of approximately 3 centimeters. Place the pieces in the container you are going to use to serve the dish.</li>

        <li>Mix the fish with the chopped yellow chili, fish broth and cilantro. Also place the onion cut into julienne strips and the crushed garlic. Let it rest for a few minutes so that it marinates well and soaks up all the flavors.</li>

        <li>Then, pour the lemon juice all over the plate so that everything is well covered. Finally, cut a sheet of red limo chili pepper and place it as decoration. Keep it in the refrigerator to cool, since this is a dish that is served cold. Peruvian ceviche is a dish that acts as an appetizer, so you can accompany it with rice with shrimp or a delicious salmon with shrimp sauce. Ready to eat!</li>
